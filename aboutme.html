            <h2>Hello, I'm Surya KP</h2>
            <p>
                I'm an Aspiring second year college student pursuing Btech CSE with specialization in AIML at SRMIST, Katankulathur with an aim to change the world through my skills and knowledge.</br>
                My fascination and love for these magnificent creatures started at a young age, sparked by encounters with documentaries and wildlife books.</br>
                I have always been a lover and an admirer of animals, in order to protect and preserve these absolute beauties of our world, I've created this website.</br>
                As I delved deeper into the subject, I became increasingly aware of the alarming rate at which species are disappearing due to human activities such as habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change.</br>
                This realization propelled me to take action and contribute to the conservation efforts in any way I could.</br>
            </p>
            <h3>SUE - Save US Endangeredspecies</h3>
            <p>
                The main goal of this website is to raise awareness when it comes to endangered species.</br>
                Motivated by my passion and driven by a sense of responsibility, I decided to create this website as a platform to raise awareness about the plight of endangered species.</br>
                In my website, The animals talk in their own perspectives of what has been happening to them and the habitats they live in.</br>
                Through captivating imagery, and impactful stories, I aim to shed light on the challenges faced by these animals and the urgent need for conservation action.
                
                <br></br>
                My goal is not only to inform but also to inspire others to join the fight to protect our planet's biodiversity.<br>
                By fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation for endangered species, I believe we can work together to create a future where wildlife thrives alongside humanity.</br>

                Join me on this journey to make a difference and safeguard the wonders of our natural world for generations to come.<br>

                Together, we can be the voice for the voiceless and ensure a brighter future for all living beings.</br>
